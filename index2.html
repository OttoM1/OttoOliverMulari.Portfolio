<strong>
    Introduction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Our world is overflowing with an ever-expanding volume of information. From your personal devices, corporate databases to governmental and healthcare records, the data is accumulating at an astonishing rate. ​Recent studies indicate that global data generation is experiencing exponential  growth. In the year 2023 approximately 120 zettabytes of data were created, and this figure is projected to reach 190 zettabytes by the end of 2025. This rapid growth underscores the increasing digitization of various sectors and the critical reliance on data-driven technologies.​ The sheer scale of this information needs to be stored, categorized, and managed. Fortunately, the development of information systems has made this once-impossible task feasible. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The dominance of information systems in the corporate world is not a recent phenomenon. Its roots trace back to the end of World War II with early computing technologies such as the ENIAC and UNIVAC marking the dawn of automated data processing. This technological revolution has since reshaped industries, profoundly enhancing corporate operations, decision-making, and communication. However, the widespread integration of information systems has also introduced significant challenges, particularly in the realm of user experience (UX).
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Impact of Automation on UX</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping corporate operations as businesses increasingly rely on automated systems for customer service, decision-making, and operational  efficiency. However, automation introduces UX challenges especially when AI-driven systems fail. Research by Pavone, Meyer-Waarden, and Munzel (2023) examines the psychological and emotional consequences of AI service failures, revealing that such failures not only generate negative emotional responses but also influence user perceptions of responsibility.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Balance of Automation and Human Interaction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Chatbot-based customer service a worthy investment, or does automation compromise the human touch? One of the most pressing questions surrounding information systems is their impact on UX in customer service and workplace interactions. While automation offers efficiency and scalability, it often comes at the expense of human intuition and emotional intelligence. Customer service systems increasingly seem to rely on chatbots and automated responses to streamline interactions and reduce operational costs. However, the effectiveness of these solutions remains debatable. The growing prevalence of chatbots in customer service and workplace interactions presents both opportunities and challenges for UX.
    <br>
    <br>
    Recent research by Chin, Zhunis, and Cha (2024) examines how frequent chatbot users interact with these systems, providing key insights into user satisfaction and expectations. While chatbots are designed to improve efficiency and provide quick responses, their effectiveness largely  depends on how well they meet user needs and the quality of interactions they offer. Many users adjust their communication style to work around chatbot limitations simplifying their queries or anticipating pre-programmed responses. However, this does not always lead to better experiences. The study suggested that users remain doubtful about chatbots’ ability to handle more complex, emotionally sensitive, or overly-specific issues, exposing a major weakness in automated customer service.
    <br>
    <br>
    From a UX standpoint, these findings highlight a growing concern: relying too much on chatbots may reduce the overall quality of user interactions. If customers feel that automated systems are not addressing their needs properly, their trust in the company may decline. Similarly, in workplaces where employees rely heavily on automated decision-making, there is a risk of losing essential skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. To create a better UX, companies should design chatbot systems that support rather than replace human communication, which many still do, but for how long before it is completely replaced by AI. A hybrid approach where automation improves efficiency but human support is available for more complex cases, is the most effective way forward, as for now.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>The Risk of Over-Automation, UX</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond customer service automation is also transforming the workplace. Employees who depend too much on automation may lose sight of broader strategic goals, weakening their ability to think critically and creatively. AI-driven decision-making also raises concerns about transparency and accountability. When algorithms control key processes like hiring, performance reviews, and workflow management, employees may feel disconnected from important decisions, leading to lower job satisfaction and engagement. Companies must assess not only how efficient automated systems are but also how they impact employee experience and workplace UX.
    <br>
    <br>
    A study by Esmark Jones, Hancock, Kazandjian, and Voorhees (2022) emphasizes the role of authenticity in chatbot interactions. It shows that customer trust depends on chatbots’ ability to feel more human, offering personalization and context aware responses. When chatbots fail to provide this they come across as impersonal and ineffective, damaging customer confidence. These insights reinforce the need to design automated systems that align with human expectations, ensuring they build trust and engagement rather than alienate users.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> The Future of UX: Is AI Always the Answer </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    As technology continues to evolve, businesses must address the UX challenges that come with automated systems. As an example, imagine a frustrated customer reaching out to a chatbot for help with a personal issue and despite providing all the necessary details, the chatbot only responds with generic troubleshoting steps that fail to solve the problem. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to get real help, the customer’s frustration turns to anger.
    <br>
    <br>
    Research by Huang and Dootson (2022) suggests that when chatbot-driven service failures leave users feeling ignored or stuck in an endless loop of unhelpful responses, it can lead to aggression. Unlike human agents, chatbots often cannot recognize when a customer is getting frustrated, nor can they adjust their responses to calm the situation. This lack of adaptability can harm a company’s reputation, causing customers to switch to competitors with better support. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, research by Ozuem, Ranfagni, Willis, Salvietti, and Howell (2024) explores how chatbot failures impact customer loyalty. Their findings suggest that unresolved chatbot issues don’t just frustrate users in the moment—they create long-term negative impressions. Customers who feel neglected by AI driven systems often see the company as indifferent to their needs, making them more  likely to take their business elsewhere. This underscores the need for chatbots to have adaptive responses that acknowledge customer emotions and build trust. Hybrid-approach ensures that automation improves, not worsens the customer experience.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Front-End Solution</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    It is easy to view information systems as either entirely beneficial or entirely harmful, but the reality is more complex. Their success depends on how they are designed and implemented. Businesses must ensure that automation complements human interactions rather than replaces them.
    Ultimately, the effectiveness of information systems in the corporate world depends on their ability to enhance—not hinder—the user experience. As businesses continue to refine their digital strategies, a user-centric approach will be critical in ensuring that technological advancements serve both organizations and the individuals who interact with them. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Eventually, the implications of these findings extend beyond customer service, signaling a broader societal shift in human interaction. As individuals become increasingly accustomed to AI-driven communication, which tend to be often designed overly accommodating and predictable, they may struggle with face to face interactions that require spontaneity and emotional nuance. So if businesses feel the must to keep prioritizing automation without considering its long-term impact on UX, they risk not only diminishing the quality of digital interactions but also inadvertently isolating both users and employees in an ecosystem where authentic human engagement becomes a rarity.
