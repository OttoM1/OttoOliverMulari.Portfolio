            <h2>❓ About Me</h2>
            <p>A 21-year-old Information Processing Science student at the University of Oulu, currently in my first year. Highly passionate about software development, problem-solving, artificial intelligence, and continually expanding my technical knowledge. My core expertise at the moment lies in C and Java, as well as different computational calculations such as binary, hexadecimals, boolean algebra. On top of that, a rapidly growing knowledge in device/memory/component understanding.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active outside of university life through weight lifting, submission wrestling, and golf during the summer. I am a strong believer in lifelong learning and often conduct self-studying on different topics. Recently, I familiarized myself with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to enhance my skill set.</p>
            <p>I pride myself on being an adaptive individual, consantly pushing the boundaries, and unafraid of new challenges or setbacks. Always eager to learn and grow from new experiences. This mindset has equipped me to tackle complex problems while continually refining both my technical expertise and personal skills. I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world corporate projects and am actively seeking opportunities that will prepare me for future challenges in the professional world.</p>
